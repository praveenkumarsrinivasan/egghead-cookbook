Goal: Convert this repo from Jekyll GitHub Pages to MkDocs Material with search and GitHub Actions deployment.

Please do the following, making minimal disruptive changes:

1) Create a docs/ directory and move the site content into it:
   - Move index.md -> docs/index.md (create if missing)
   - Move recipes.md -> docs/recipes.md (create if missing)
   - Move recipes/ -> docs/recipes/
   - Move assets/ -> docs/assets/ (if exists)
   - If there are Jekyll-specific files like _config.yml, keep them for now but we won't use them.

2) Add mkdocs.yml at repo root using Material theme and search plugin.
   - Use a nav with Home, Categories, and a Recipes section listing each category index.
   - Ensure paths match the docs/ layout.

3) Add a GitHub Actions workflow at .github/workflows/deploy.yml that:
   - runs on push to main and workflow_dispatch
   - installs mkdocs-material (or requirements.txt if present)
   - runs: mkdocs gh-deploy --force
   - writes to gh-pages branch

4) Add requirements.txt (pin mkdocs-material) if missing.

5) Update README.md (or create it) with:
   - local dev instructions: python venv, pip install -r requirements.txt, mkdocs serve
   - deployment notes: GitHub Pages should point to gh-pages branch

6) Ensure all markdown links still work after moves.
   - Fix any relative links that broke due to the docs/ move.
   - Keep recipe pages readable in MkDocs.

7) Provide a short checklist at the end: commands to run mkdocs serve locally, and git commands to commit.

Do the edits directly in the repo. Prefer moving files over copying.
