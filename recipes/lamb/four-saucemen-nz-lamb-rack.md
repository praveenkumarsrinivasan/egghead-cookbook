## Recipe Essentials

Serves: 2-4 people

- EGG setup: indirect, then direct for sear
- Recommended charcoal: oak, cherry, or hickory
- EGG target temperature: 225°F (107°C) indirect, then 550°F (288°C) for sear
- Cooking time: 35-60 minutes plus 15 minutes rest

## Ingredients

- 1 lamb rack (NZ lamb preferred)
- Olive oil (binder)
- The Four Saucemen Lamb Rub
- Sea salt (optional, to finish)

## Equipment

- ConvEGGtor or other indirect setup
- Drip pan or aluminum tray
- Instant-read thermometer
- Tongs

## Overview

This is a reverse-seared lamb rack: low-and-slow over indirect heat to build smoke flavor, then a fast, high-heat sear to finish the crust.

## Method

1. Trim the lamb rack. Remove the silver skin and clean the bones. If leaving the fat cap on, score it lightly. Wrap the bones in foil to protect them from over-browning.
2. Lightly coat the lamb with olive oil, then apply The Four Saucemen Lamb Rub generously on all sides.
3. Set up the EGG for indirect cooking at 225°F (107°C). Add one chunk of smoking wood and place a drip pan under the grate.
4. Cook the lamb over indirect heat until the internal temperature reaches 135°F (57°C).
5. Rest the lamb under tented foil for 15 minutes.
6. Open the vents and bring the EGG up to 550°F (288°C). Sear the lamb quickly, rendering the fat cap if left on. Re-season with a pinch of salt if desired.
7. Slice between the bones and serve.

## Notes

- Pull earlier for a rarer center (125-130°F / 52-54°C) or later for more doneness.
- Keep the bones wrapped until after the sear for clean presentation.
