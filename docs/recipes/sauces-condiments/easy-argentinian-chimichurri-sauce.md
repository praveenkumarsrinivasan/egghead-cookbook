## Overview

Bright, herby chimichurri with a mix of fresh herbs and a light lemon bite.

## Ingredients

- 1 bunch flat-leaf parsley
- 1 bunch cilantro (coriander)
- 1 bunch fresh oregano
- 4-5 sprigs thyme (leaves only)
- 2-3 cloves garlic
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 1 mild-to-medium chili
- Olive oil, to blend
- Salt, to taste

## Method

1. Wash and dry the herbs. Roughly chop and place in a food processor.
2. Add chopped chili, garlic, salt, and lemon juice.
3. Pulse until herbs are finely chopped. Do most of the blending before adding oil.
4. With the motor running on medium, drizzle in olive oil until the mixture is spoonable and glossy.
5. Avoid over-processing after adding oil to prevent the sauce from turning cloudy.
6. Scoop into a bowl and serve. Keeps in the fridge for several hours.
