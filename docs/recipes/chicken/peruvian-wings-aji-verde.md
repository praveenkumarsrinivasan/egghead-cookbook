Wing sauce:

- 1 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/2 small shallot, finely minced
- 60 ml soy sauce
- 10 ml fresh orange juice
- 60 ml fresh lime juice
- 3 Tbsp honey
- 2 Tbsp adobo marinated chipotle peppers, minced
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp cilantro leaves, minced

Aji verde sauce:

- 16 g cilantro leaves
- 1 serrano pepper, seeded
- 1 small-to-medium garlic clove
- 120 g mayonnaise
- 82 g sour cream
- 1 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp white wine vinegar
- 1 pinch kosher salt

## Method

1. Remove wing tips and set aside for stock. Toss wings with olive oil, salt, and optional rub. Season at least 45 minutes before cooking.
2. Preheat the EGG for indirect roasting at 325 F (163 C).
3. Blend aji verde ingredients until smooth, or finely mince the cilantro and garlic and mix with the remaining ingredients. Refrigerate while the wings cook.
4. Arrange wings in a single layer on a roasting pan or grid. Roast for 30-35 minutes, until lightly browned and 165 F (75 C) internal temperature.
5. While the wings roast, make the glaze. Warm olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and shallot and cook until lightly golden, 2-3 minutes.
6. Add soy sauce, orange juice, lime juice, honey, chipotle, cumin, smoked paprika, and cilantro. Simmer, stirring often, until the sauce thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon.
7. Transfer wings to a large bowl. Toss with the wing sauce until evenly coated.
8. Plate the wings, drizzle with aji verde, and serve.

## Notes

- You can blend the wing sauce for a smoother finish.
