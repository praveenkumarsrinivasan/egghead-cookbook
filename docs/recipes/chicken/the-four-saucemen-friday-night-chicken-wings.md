## Overview

Slow-smoked, then hot-crisped wings finished in buffalo sauce.

## Ingredients

- Chicken wings, as many as you need (larger wings are best)
- The Four Saucemen Chicken Rub
- Culley's Buffalo Wing Sauce (No. 2 for mild heat, No. 6 for hot)
- Duck fat spray or olive oil spray
- Smoking wood (oak recommended)

## Method

1. Separate wings into flappers and drummies. Discard tips.
2. Place on a rack over a tray and refrigerate uncovered overnight to dry the skin (optional but improves crispness).
3. Set up for indirect cooking at 225 F with smoking wood. Use a foil tray under the grill to catch fat.
4. Lightly spray wings and coat all sides with the chicken rub.
5. Smoke wings, turning every 10 minutes, until they reach about 155 F internal (30-40 minutes depending on size).
6. Toss wings in buffalo sauce.
7. Open vents and raise grill to 450 F. Return wings to the grill and cook until crisp and 175-185 F internal.
