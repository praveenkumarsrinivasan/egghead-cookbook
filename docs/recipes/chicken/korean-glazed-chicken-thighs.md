## Ingredients

Chicken:

- 12 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 24 wooden or stainless steel skewers (2 per thigh, hibachi style)
- Duck fat spray (or any neutral oil spray)
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Gochujang basting:

- 113 g gochujang (Korean chili paste)
- 133 ml soy sauce
- 56 g honey (or agave nectar)
- 56 g rice wine vinegar
- 2 g kosher salt
- 4 g freshly ground black pepper
- 1 green apple, peeled
- 1 nashi pear, peeled
- 50 g fresh pineapple (optional)
- 18 g garlic cloves
- 18 g fresh ginger, peeled
- 1 small red onion, finely diced
- Water, as needed to loosen

Garnish:

- 1 scallion, finely sliced
- 1 sprig fresh coriander, leaves only
- 5 g toasted sesame seeds

## Method

1. If using wooden skewers, soak in water for at least 30 minutes.
2. Trim any cartilage from the thighs. Season with salt, pepper, and a light spray of duck fat.
3. Thread each thigh on two skewers about 25 mm apart. Refrigerate on a tray until ready to grill.
4. Blend gochujang, soy sauce, honey, vinegar, ginger, and garlic until smooth.
5. Add apple and pear; blend again until smooth. Add pineapple if using.
6. Stir in diced red onion. Add a splash of water if you need to thin the basting.
7. Preheat charcoal to 390-400 F (200 C). Hibachi, yakitori, or kettle grills work well.
8. Grill thighs, turning once they color. Begin basting after the first flip.
9. Continue flipping and basting until the internal temperature reaches 159 F (70 C).
10. Rest 3-5 minutes, then garnish with scallion, coriander, and sesame seeds.
