## Recipe Essentials

- EGG setup: indirect smoke
- EGG target temperature: 250-275F

## Ingredients

- The Four Saucemen Pork Rib Rub
- 4-5 kg pork butt or shoulder
- Olive oil or mustard (binder)
- Foil tray large enough for the pork and foil to cover
- 100 g butter
- 100 ml clear apple juice
- 100 ml lager-style beer
- The Four Saucemen Rib Glaze

Spritz:

- 1 part Worcestershire sauce
- 1 part clear apple juice
- 1 part apple cider vinegar
- 1 part water

## Method

1. Set up the EGG for indirect cooking at 250-275F with two pieces of smoking wood.
2. Trim any hard fat on the shoulder. Apply a thin layer of olive oil or mustard and coat with pork rib rub.
3. Smoke uncovered for 3-4 hours, spritzing every hour. Target about 160F internal.
4. Prepare a foil tray with apple juice, beer, and butter at room temperature. Place the pork in the tray and cover tightly with foil.
5. Return to the EGG until internal temperature reaches 205F. Probe for tenderness; you can take it to 210F.
6. Let steam escape for 5 minutes, then cover and rest in a towel-wrapped cooler for at least 45 minutes (preferably 1.5 hours).
7. Uncover, remove the bone, and pull the pork. Drizzle with rib glaze and season as needed.
