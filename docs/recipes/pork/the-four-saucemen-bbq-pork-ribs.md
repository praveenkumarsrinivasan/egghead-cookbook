# The Four Saucemen BBQ Pork Ribs

## Recipe Essentials

- EGG setup: indirect smoke
- EGG target temperature: 250-275F

## Ingredients

- The Four Saucemen Pork Rib Rub
- Wichita pork ribs
- Olive oil or mustard (binder)
- Heavy-duty foil
- 50 g butter
- 2 tbsp soft brown sugar
- The Four Saucemen Rib Glaze

Spritz:

- 1 part Worcestershire sauce
- 1 part clear apple juice
- 1 part apple cider vinegar
- 1 part water

## Method

1. Defrost ribs overnight in the fridge. Remove the thin membrane on the bone side.
2. Set up the EGG for indirect cooking at 250-275F with two pieces of smoking wood.
3. Apply a thin layer of olive oil or mustard. Coat generously with pork rib rub and let it sweat for 30 minutes.
4. Place ribs bone side down and smoke uncovered for 2 hours, spritzing every hour. The ribs should be dark mahogany (2.5 hours max).
5. On foil, place butter and brown sugar and smear with rib glaze. Place ribs meat side down and wrap tightly.
6. Cook meat side down for another 1 hour 15 minutes. Ribs should feel bendy.
7. Rest wrapped for 15-20 minutes. Warm the rib glaze.
8. Unwrap, glaze the meat side, and return to the smoker for 10-15 minutes to set.

## Notes

- Check tenderness with a bamboo skewer. If it feels tight, wrap a little longer.
