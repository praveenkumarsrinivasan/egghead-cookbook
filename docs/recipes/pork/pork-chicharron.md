- Cook time: 50 minutes
- Total time: about 1 hour + 3-4 hours drying
- Serves: 8

## Ingredients

- 4 lb (1.8 kg) pork back fat and skin (usually attached)
- 2 cups (473 ml) vinegar
- 1 cup (236 ml) water
- 2 heads garlic, peeled and crushed
- 2 Tbsp kosher salt
- 2 tsp peppercorns
- 2 L canola oil

## Method

1. Cut pork skin and fat into long strips about 2 inches wide. Insert the knife between skin and fat on one end and remove most of the fat, leaving a thin layer on the skin.
2. Combine pork skin, water, vinegar, garlic, peppercorns, and salt in a deep pot. Bring to a boil, skimming any scum.
3. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer 35-45 minutes until tender but not falling apart.
4. Drain and discard the liquid and aromatics. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to cool completely.
5. Heat the oven to 250 F (120 C). Cut the strips into 1-inch squares and place on a wire rack set over a lined tray.
6. Bake 3-4 hours until the skin is fully dried, then remove from the oven.
7. Render the reserved fat trimmings over medium-low heat until the fat liquefies. Strain through a sieve or coffee filter and reserve the solids for garnish if desired.
8. Heat oil in a deep fryer or heavy pot to 355 F (180 C).
9. Fry dried pork squares in batches for 2-4 minutes, until puffed and floating. Drain on a wire rack with paper towels and season with salt immediately.
10. Serve warm with a drink of your choice.
