# Cooking Temperature Zones

Understanding temperature zones is the single most important skill in kamado and BBQ cooking. The same grill that cold-smokes salmon at 80°F can sear a steak at 750°F — but only if you know which zone to use and why.

## The Three Main Zones

### Smoke Zone — 100–225°F (38–107°C)

This is **low-and-slow** territory. At these temperatures, wood and charcoal produce thin, clean blue smoke that gently penetrates the meat over hours. Collagen breaks down into gelatin, tough connective tissues soften, and fat renders slowly — producing the tender, pull-apart texture that defines great barbecue.

**Best for:**

- Brisket (225°F, 10–14 hours)
- Pork shoulder / pulled pork (225°F, 8–12 hours)
- Ribs (225°F, 5–6 hours)
- Smoked salmon (120–150°F, 3–4 hours)
- Beef cheeks, chuck roasts, and other tough cuts

**Tips:**

- Keep the smoke thin and blue — thick white smoke means incomplete combustion and bitter flavour.
- A water pan helps stabilise temperature and adds moisture.
- Don't rush it. Time is your main ingredient in this zone.

### Barbecue Zone — 225–350°F (107–177°C)

The **sweet spot** for most outdoor cooking. This range gives you enough heat to develop colour and bark on the outside while still cooking gently enough for the inside to reach doneness without drying out. Many pitmasters refer to the 250–275°F range as the "competition zone" for brisket and ribs.

The upper end (300–350°F) is sometimes called **hot-and-fast** — a method gaining popularity for producing excellent results in roughly half the time of traditional low-and-slow.

**Best for:**

- Whole chickens and turkeys (325–350°F)
- Bone-in chicken thighs and drumsticks (300–325°F)
- Sausages and hot dogs (275–325°F)
- Pork loin and tenderloin (325–350°F)
- Roast vegetables and potatoes (325–350°F)
- Baking bread, pizza dough, and casseroles (325–350°F)

**Low-and-slow vs hot-and-fast:**

| | Low & Slow (225–275°F) | Hot & Fast (300–350°F) |
|---|---|---|
| **Time** | Longer (often 1–1.5 hrs/lb) | Roughly half the time |
| **Smoke flavour** | Deeper, more pronounced | Milder, lighter |
| **Bark** | Thinner, darker | Thicker, crunchier |
| **Best cuts** | Large, collagen-heavy (brisket, pork butt) | Smaller cuts, ribs, chicken |
| **Texture** | Maximum tenderness and render | Firmer slice, still tender |

Both methods produce excellent results — choose based on your cut and your schedule.

### Grill Zone — 350–500°F+ (177–260°C+)

This is **direct, high-heat cooking** — the zone for searing, charring, and fast grilling. At these temperatures, the Maillard reaction kicks into high gear, creating that caramelised crust and complex flavour on the surface of your food.

A kamado like the Big Green Egg can push well beyond 500°F — up to **750°F** for steakhouse-quality searing.

**Best for:**

- Steaks (450–500°F+, 2–4 minutes per side)
- Burgers (400–450°F, 3–4 minutes per side)
- Fish steaks and seafood (400–450°F)
- Pizza (500–700°F, 2–3 minutes)
- Chicken breasts (400–450°F)
- Vegetables and fruit (400–450°F, quick char)

**Tips:**

- Preheat fully before placing food on the grate.
- For thick steaks, consider the **reverse sear**: start low (225–250°F) until 10–15°F below target internal temp, then sear over high heat for the crust.
- Keep the lid closed as much as possible — opening it drops temperature fast.

## The Full Kamado Range

One of the great advantages of a kamado cooker is its ability to cover the entire temperature spectrum. Here's the full range at a glance:

| Temperature | Zone | Cooking Style | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| 80–120°F (27–49°C) | Cold smoke | Smoking without cooking | Cheese, salmon, bacon |
| 120–180°F (49–82°C) | Warm smoke | Dehydrating, jerky | Beef jerky, dried fruits |
| 200–250°F (93–121°C) | Low & slow | Traditional barbecue | Brisket, pulled pork, ribs |
| 250–350°F (121–177°C) | Roast / bake | Roasting, baking, hot & fast | Whole chicken, bread, casseroles |
| 350–450°F (177–232°C) | Grill | Direct grilling | Steaks, burgers, chops, fish |
| 450–500°F (232–260°C) | High grill | Fast sear, charring | Thin steaks, vegetables, flatbreads |
| 500–750°F (260–400°C) | Inferno | Pizza, steakhouse sear | Neapolitan pizza, reverse sear finish |

## Temperature Control on the Egg

The kamado's ceramic walls and adjustable vents make precise temperature control straightforward:

- **Lower temperatures** — Close down both the bottom draft door and top daisy wheel. Less airflow = less combustion = lower heat.
- **Higher temperatures** — Open both vents wider. More air feeds the fire.
- **Steady hold** — Make small adjustments and wait 10–15 minutes between changes. The ceramic holds temperature with remarkable stability.
- **Avoid overshooting** — It's much easier to raise temperature than to bring it down. Creep up to your target gradually.

## The Danger Zone

One critical temperature range to be aware of: **40–140°F (4–60°C)** is the bacterial danger zone. Meat should pass through this range as quickly as possible. Never leave raw or partially cooked meat in this range for more than 2 hours (1 hour if ambient temperature is above 90°F).

Always use a reliable meat thermometer to verify internal temperatures — your food's safety depends on it.
