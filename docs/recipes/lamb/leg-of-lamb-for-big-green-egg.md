- Total time: 340 minutes
- Serves: 4
- EGG setup: indirect with convEGGtor and grid
- EGG target temperature: 355-400 F (180-205 C)

## Ingredients

Vegetables:

- 2 parsnips
- 2 red beetroots
- 2 yellow beetroots
- 2 baby purple kumara potatoes
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- Garlic, finely chopped
- Kosher salt

Leg of lamb:

- 1 small leg of lamb
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- Lamb rub of choice

## Method

1. Trim loose skin and excess fat from the lamb. Rub with olive oil and coat evenly with the lamb rub. Refrigerate for 1 1/2 hours.
2. Remove the lamb from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking. Light the EGG with the convEGGtor and grid in place, and bring to 355-400 F (180-205 C).
3. Wash the vegetables. Leave them whole. Finely chop the garlic.
4. Place the lamb on the grid and insert a probe thermometer into the center of the meat. Cook to your desired internal temperature: 130-136 F (55-58 C) for medium-rare (boneless rolled), 140-145 F (60-63 C) for medium, or 149-152 F (65-67 C) for medium-well.
5. Toss the vegetables with olive oil, garlic, and salt. When the lamb is about 77 F (25 C) below your target internal temperature, add the vegetables to the grid next to the lamb.
6. Roast the vegetables for about 1 hour while the lamb finishes.
7. Remove the lamb and vegetables from the EGG. Halve or quarter the vegetables and serve with the lamb.
