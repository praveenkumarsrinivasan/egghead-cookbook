## Overview

These lamb ribs are cooked low and slow over gentle smoke, then wrapped to finish tender and glossy.

## Recipe Essentials

Serves: 4

- Prep time: 20 minutes
- Cook time: 4 hours
- Total time: 4 hours 20 minutes (plus resting)
- EGG setup: indirect smoke
- EGG target temperature: 250-275F

## Ingredients

- 2 racks lamb ribs, membrane removed
- 2 tbsp olive oil or mustard (binder)
- 3 tbsp lamb-friendly BBQ rub (garlic, paprika, rosemary, black pepper, salt)
- 2 tbsp butter
- 2 tbsp brown sugar
- 3 tbsp honey or maple syrup
- 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- Optional: 1 tbsp tomato paste for a stickier glaze

## Method

1. Set up the EGG for indirect cooking at 250-275F with a small chunk of fruit wood.
2. Pat ribs dry. Rub with oil or mustard, then coat with the BBQ rub. Rest 15-20 minutes.
3. Smoke the ribs bone side down for 2 to 2.5 hours until the color is deep bronze. Spritz with water or apple juice if the surface looks dry.
4. Lay out foil. Add butter, brown sugar, honey, and vinegar (plus tomato paste if using). Place ribs meat side down and wrap tightly.
5. Return to the EGG meat side down for 60-90 minutes, until the ribs feel flexible and a skewer slides in easily.
6. Unwrap and place ribs back on the EGG for 10-15 minutes to set the glaze.
7. Rest 10 minutes, slice, and serve.

## Notes

- Lamb ribs vary in thickness; check tenderness rather than time.
- If you prefer a drier bark, skip the wrap and cook uncovered until tender.
