## Ingredients

Scallops:

- 1 kg sea scallops
- 3-4 eggs
- 200 g panko bread crumbs
- 250 g plain flour
- 3 tbsp The Four Saucemen jalapeno & sweet orange rub
- 2 L vegetable oil, for shallow frying

Optional add-ons:

- 45 g finely grated Parmesan cheese (fresh)
- 28 g finely grated Romano cheese (fresh)
- Lemon wedges, for serving

## Method

1. Rinse scallops in cold water, trim off the muscle, and drain on paper towels. Pat dry.
2. Set up a breading station: beat eggs in one bowl, place panko in another, and flour in a third.
3. Mix the jalapeno & sweet orange rub into the panko crumbs (add cheeses if using).
4. Dredge scallops in flour, shake off excess, dip in egg, then coat in seasoned panko. Press lightly to adhere.
5. Place breaded scallops on a tray with a few crumbs on the base so they do not stick. Repeat until all scallops are breaded.
6. Refrigerate the tray for 20-30 minutes to set the coating.
7. Heat oil for shallow frying to 356 F (180 C).
8. Fry scallops in batches of 5-6 for about 2-3 minutes, until golden brown.
9. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined colander to drain.
10. Serve with your favorite condiment (tartare sauce, cocktail sauce) and lemon wedges.
