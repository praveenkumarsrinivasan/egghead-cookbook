# The Four Saucemen BBQ Beef Cheeks

## Overview

The Four Saucemen BBQ Beef Cheeks

## Ingredients

- The Four Saucemen Beef Rub
- 2-6 beef cheeks
- Olive oil (binder)
- Foil tray large enough for the cheeks
- Foil to cover the tray
- Dark beer
- Beef broth
- 1 onion, chopped
- One great bottle of red for the chef

## Spritz

- 1 part Worcestershire sauce
- 1 part clear apple juice
- 1 part apple cider vinegar
- 1 part water

Mix in a spray bottle.

## Method

1. Open a beer (repeat if necessary) and a good bottle of red to breathe.
2. Set your BBQ or smoker for indirect cooking at 250-275F with two pieces of smoking wood. We used Pohutukawa.
3. About 30 minutes before smoking, trim any silver skin and hard fat from the cheeks.
4. Lightly coat with olive oil and apply The Four Saucemen Beef Rub on all sides.
5. Place the cheeks on the BBQ (use a drip pan). Smoke uncovered for 2.5 hours for small cheeks (about 500 g) or about 4 hours for large cheeks (about 1 kg). Spritz every hour.
6. The cheeks should be dark brown. If using a probe thermometer, expect around 150-160F.
7. Prepare a foil tray with dark beer, beef broth, and chopped onion (wine, port, or beef stock also work). You want 15-20 mm of liquid in the base. Use room-temperature liquids.
8. Place the cheeks in the tray, cover tightly with foil, and braise. If using a Bluetooth thermometer, insert it before covering.
9. Return the tray to the BBQ until the internal temperature reaches about 210F, usually 2.5-4 hours depending on size.
10. Carefully uncover and check doneness. The probe should slide in with almost no resistance. For slicing, cook until about 205F instead.

These are great for tacos, quesadillas, or served with a simple salad. This method also works for beef shin.
