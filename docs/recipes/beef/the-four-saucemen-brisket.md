## Overview

The Four Saucemen Brisket Steps ("The Holy Grail of BBQ")

This recipe is designed for a 6-10 kg brisket.

## Choosing Your Brisket

There is now a great selection of brisket available in NZ: small to large, grass-fed, grain-finished Wagyu, Aussie imports, and USA briskets. Look for good fat, marbling, and a thick flat. If you are unsure, ask your butcher. The point end is fatty and forgiving; the flat is where most of us get frustrated.

## Ingredients

- The Four Saucemen Beef Rub
- 1 large whole brisket (Snake River Farms USA, Wakanui NZ, Ocean Beef NZ, First Light NZ, or Black Onyx AUS)
- Olive oil (binder)
- Foil tray large enough to fit the brisket
- Foil to cover the tray or quality peach paper
- Dark beer
- Beef broth or stock
- 1 onion, chopped
- One great bottle of red for the chef and a couple of beers for good measure

## Spritz

- 1 part Worcestershire sauce
- 1 part clear apple juice
- 1 part apple cider vinegar
- 1 part water

Mix in a spray bottle.

## Method

1. Open a beer (repeat if necessary) and a good bottle of red to breathe. Every brisket varies by breed, fat content, and size.
2. Set your BBQ or smoker for indirect cooking at 250-275F with smoking wood. We used oak in a Lonestar Grillz offset and hickory on a Big Green Egg. If your brisket looks lean, run a lower temp.
3. Allow the brisket to come to room temperature (this can take hours). Trim any silver skin and hard fat, leaving the softer fat to protect the meat. About 30 minutes before cooking, lightly coat with olive oil and apply The Four Saucemen Beef Rub on all sides.
4. Smoke uncovered for about 4 hours. Fat side up on an offset, fat side down on the Big Green Egg. Use a drip pan. Spritz every hour. The bark should be dark brown and set (it should not smudge when you gently rub it). Internal temperature is typically around 150-160F at this stage.
5. Prepare a foil tray with dark beer, beef broth, and chopped onion (wine, port, or beef stock also work). You want 15-20 mm of liquid in the base, and the liquids should be room temperature. Place the brisket in the tray, insert a temp probe if using one, and cover tightly with foil. Alternatively, wrap in quality peach paper with some of the liquid and onion.
6. Return the covered brisket to the smoker. When internal temperature reaches around 200F, start checking the feel.
7. Probe with an instant-read thermometer. It should slide in like room-temperature butter with little resistance. Check the point and the flat. Internal temps can vary from 200F to 215F; feel matters most.
8. Rest: Unwrap and let the brisket sit in the juices so steam can escape (at least 15 minutes). Rewrap, cover with a towel, and rest in a cooler/chilli bin/esky for about 2 hours if you can wait.
9. Slice the flat across the grain. Use the point for burnt ends or slices.

Brisket is extremely versatile: burgers, soups, pies, pizza topping, or freshly sliced on white bread with a little reduced gravy and mustard.
