## Recipe Essentials

- EGG setup: indirect, then direct for sear
- EGG target temperature: 225F indirect, 550F for sear

## Ingredients

Steak:

- The Four Saucemen The Beef Rub
- Best steak you can buy (tomahawk rib eyes are great for a party)
- Flaky sea salt, to season
- Olive oil, for coating

Steak butter:

- 250 g butter
- 1 large shallot, finely diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 cup flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup sage, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup tarragon, finely chopped
- 1/2 tsp finely grated lemon zest
- 1 tsp ground black pepper
- Salt, to taste

## Method

1. Mix the steak butter ingredients. Roll in food wrap into logs and freeze what you do not need.
2. Set up the Big Green Egg for indirect cooking at 225F with two pieces of smoking wood.
3. Cook the beef from room temperature. Coat lightly with olive oil and apply a fine layer of beef rub 10 minutes before grilling.
4. Once the EGG is stable at 225F, place the steak in the center of the grill. Turn every 10 minutes.
5. For a 6 cm thick steak, expect about 45-50 minutes to reach medium-rare. Target internal temperatures: 115-120F rare, 125-130F medium rare, 135F medium.
6. Remove the steak and rest under a tented foil.
7. Carefully remove the ConvEGGtor. Open the vents and heat the EGG to 550F. Preheat cast iron or grill grates if you have them.
8. Sear the steaks for 1 minute per side, turning at 30 seconds for diamond marks.
9. Top with steak butter while resting and season with flaky sea salt if needed.

## Notes

- Reverse sear works best for steaks thicker than 3 cm, especially scotch fillet or rib eye.
- The recipe does not recommend cooking past medium.
