## Overview

The Four Saucemen BBQ Beef Short Ribs (8-9 hour cook)

## Ingredients

- The Four Saucemen Beef Rub
- Beef short ribs (Wakanui, Ocean Beef, Silver Fern Farms Reserve, or similar)
- Olive oil (binder)

## Spritz

- 1 part Worcestershire sauce
- 1 part clear apple juice
- 1 part apple cider vinegar
- 1 part water

Mix in a spray bottle.

## Method

1. Open a beer (repeat if necessary).
2. Remove the ribs from the fridge and bring to room temperature.
3. Trim the top side to expose the meat under the fat. Remove any silver skin.
4. Set your Big Green Egg or smoker for indirect cooking at 250-275F with two pieces of smoking wood. We used Pohutukawa for beef.
5. About 10 minutes before smoking, apply a thin layer of olive oil and a light coat of The Four Saucemen Beef Rub.
6. Place the ribs on the Egg, bone side down. Smoke uncovered and spritz every 1.5 hours.
7. Cook until internal temperature is around 200F, about 8-9 hours. Probe with a bamboo skewer; it should feel like very soft butter with little resistance.
8. Once it probes tender all over, cook for another hour.
9. Remove and rest for 10 minutes.

Beef short ribs are extremely fatty and delicious. A chimichurri (Jess Pryles recipe) is a great dressing to cut through the richness.
