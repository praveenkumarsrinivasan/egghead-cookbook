# Smoked Herb Rib Roast

## Recipe Essentials

Serves: 24 (about 150 g portions using a 7.3 kg roast)

- Prep time: 75 minutes
- Cook time: 4-6 hours
- Total time: 7 hours 15 minutes
- EGG setup: indirect smoke
- EGG target temperature: 225-250F

## Ingredients

- 3.6-7.3 kg beef ribeye roast

Herb paste:

- 59 ml olive oil
- 28 g kosher salt
- 28 g freshly ground black pepper
- 14 g finely chopped fresh rosemary
- 14 g finely chopped fresh thyme
- 14 g finely chopped fresh sage

Garnish:

- 14 g finely chopped fresh parsley (optional)

## Method

1. Combine the herb paste ingredients and spread evenly over the roast at least 1 hour before cooking. Bring the roast to room temperature before it goes on the EGG.
2. Preheat the smoker to 225-250F.
3. Add wood chunks or pellets for smoke as desired.
4. Insert a thermometer into the thickest part of the roast without touching bone or fat. Place the roast rib side down and smoke for 4-6 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 135-140F for medium rare or 155F for medium.
5. Rest under a foil tent for 15-20 minutes (the temperature will rise about 5F).
6. Carve between the ribs. For thinner slices, remove the ribs first.
7. Season with salt and parsley as desired.

## Notes

- For medium rare, pull at 135-140F. For medium, pull at 155F.
- Leftovers portion well for sandwiches or ready-to-eat meals.
