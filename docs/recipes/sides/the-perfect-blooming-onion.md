- 1/2 tbsp baking powder
- 1 large white or brown onion
- Canola oil, for frying

Dry mix:

- 3 tsp kosher salt
- 3 tsp coarse black pepper
- 2 tsp garlic powder
- 3 tsp ancho chili powder (or 1/3 tsp cayenne)
- 2 tsp chili powder

## Method

1. Whisk the dipping sauce ingredients. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
2. Whisk milk and eggs in a large bowl.
3. In another bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and dry mix.
4. Heat enough oil in a deep pot to submerge the onion to 375 F (190 C).
5. Trim the top of the onion so it sits flat, keeping the root intact. Peel the onion.
6. With a sharp knife, make 6 cuts around the onion about 1/2 inch from the root, then make 6 more cuts between them.
7. Gently spread the petals apart to form a bloom.
8. Sprinkle lightly with cornstarch.
9. Coat the onion in the dry mix, dip into the milk mixture, then coat in the dry mix again.
10. Shake off excess flour and lower into hot oil.
11. Fry 5-7 minutes until deep golden brown and crispy.
12. Drain briefly and serve with the dipping sauce.
