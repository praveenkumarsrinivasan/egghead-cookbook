- Total time: 26 hours (includes 24-hour chill)
- EGG setup: indirect
- EGG target temperature: 350F, then 325F

## Ingredients

Crust:

- 2 1/2 cups crushed graham cracker crumbs (about 210 g)
- 1/4 cup sugar (50 g)
- 3/4 cup butter, melted (170 g)

Cheesecake filling:

- 4 x 8 oz (905 g) packages cream cheese, at room temperature
- 1 1/3 cups sugar (267 g)

- 3 tsp vanilla extract

## Method

1. Set up the EGG for indirect cooking with the ConvEGGtor at 350F.
2. Mix the crust ingredients until they hold together. Wrap foil around the bottom of a springform pan to prevent leaks.
3. Press the crust into the pan, up about 1 inch on the sides, and bake 10-15 minutes until edges are lightly golden. Cool for 30 minutes.
4. Lower the EGG temperature to 325F.
5. Beat cream cheese on medium until smooth (about 5 minutes). Add sugar and mix until combined.
6. Add eggs one at a time, mixing until the yellow disappears after each addition.
7. Stir in sour cream and vanilla on low or with a spatula until just combined.
8. Pour filling into the crust and smooth the top.
9. Bake about 1.5 hours until the top is just golden.
10. Cool on a rack for 2-3 hours without opening the springform pan.
11. Cover with plastic wrap pressed onto the cheesecake and refrigerate for 24 hours.
12. Top with fresh strawberries and serve.
