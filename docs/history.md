# The Story of the Kamado & Big Green Egg

## 3,000+ Years of Fire & Clay

Long before gas grills and backyard smokers, ancient civilisations were cooking with clay. Clay cooking vessels dating back over **3,000 years** have been found in China — simple, dome-shaped pots fuelled by wood and charcoal that trapped heat and smoke to cook food with remarkable efficiency.

The concept travelled from China to Korea and eventually to Japan around **300–500 AD**, where it evolved into a staple of Japanese kitchens.

## The Tandoor — Clay Cooking's Other Legend

While the kamado was taking shape in East Asia, another clay cooker was making history further west. The **tandoor** — a cylindrical clay oven — traces its roots to the **Indus Valley Civilisation around 2600 BC**. Archaeologists have found clay oven remnants with signs of cooked food at sites like Kalibangan in India and Harappa in modern-day Pakistan.

The word *tandoor* comes from the Persian *tanur*, itself derived from the Akkadian *tinuru* — meaning "mud oven." These ovens spread across South Asia, Central Asia, and the Middle East, becoming essential to cuisines from Punjab to Persia to the Caucasus.

A tandoor is a **tall, vase-shaped clay oven** — open at the top, with charcoal or wood burning at the base. Food is either lowered in on skewers (kebabs, tikka) or slapped directly onto the scorching inner walls (naan, roti, lavash). Temperatures inside a tandoor can exceed **480°C (900°F)**, giving food that signature charred exterior and smoky depth.

Skilled craftsmen known as **Kumhars** traditionally build tandoors by hand, using a special sand-free clay mixed with *munji* grass for durability. From Indian restaurants to Central Asian roadside stalls, the tandoor remains one of the most widely used clay cookers on the planet — a 4,600-year-old design that still hasn't been improved upon.

## The Mushikamado — Japan's Rice Cooker

In Japanese, *kamado* simply means "stove" or "cooking range." The Japanese refined the clay cooker into the **mushikamado** — a round clay pot with a removable domed lid, typically found in southern Japan.

The mushikamado was purpose-built for **steaming rice**: a pot of rice and water sat inside the sealed ceramic chamber, with charcoal below providing steady, even heat. Families used them for everyday cooking and ceremonial occasions alike.

What made the design special was its **thermal efficiency** — the thick clay walls absorbed and radiated heat evenly, while the tight-fitting dome trapped moisture. The same principles that made perfect rice also happened to make incredible barbecue.

## From Japan to America — A Post-War Discovery

After **World War II**, American servicemen stationed in Japan discovered these dome-shaped clay cookers. Amazed by the flavour and juiciness of food cooked in them — so different from the metal charcoal grills back home — many shipped kamados back to the United States.

In the **1960s**, airline pilot **Richard Johnson** designed and patented improvements to the mushikamado while flying routes to Japan. He added a grill grate, hinged metal bands, and a sliding draft door — turning a traditional rice cooker into a versatile barbecue.

Word spread slowly through the southern United States, where low-and-slow cooking was already a way of life. The kamado had found its people.

## Ed Fisher & the Birth of Big Green Egg

The real turning point came in **1974** in Atlanta, Georgia.

**Ed Fisher**, a Navy veteran from Philadelphia, had travelled to Japan and tasted food from a kamado. He was hooked. Sensing an opportunity, he opened a small shop called **The Pachinko Palace** in Atlanta's Buckhead neighbourhood, importing two Japanese products: pachinko arcade machines and clay kamado grills.

The kamados were originally a side business to fill slow seasons. Fisher's sales tactic was simple — he'd set up a kamado on the sidewalk outside his shop and cook chicken wings. The aroma did the rest.

> *"It only took thirty minutes to make my first sale."*
> — Ed Fisher

As pachinko sales declined with the rise of electronic video games, Fisher went all-in on kamados. He looked at the round, domed cooker one day and saw exactly what it was — a **big green egg**. The name stuck.

## The Ceramic Revolution

Those early imported clay kamados had one major problem: they were **fragile**. Exposure to rain, freezing temperatures, and general wear would crack them.

Fisher knew the design was brilliant but the material needed to change. Through a connection at the **Georgia Institute of Technology**, he was introduced to advanced ceramics — materials originally developed for aerospace and NASA's space programme.

In the **mid-1990s**, Big Green Egg stopped importing clay cookers from Asia entirely. They began manufacturing their own EGGs using a proprietary blend of advanced ceramics that could:

- Withstand extreme temperatures (up to 750°F / 400°C)
- Resist cracking from weather and thermal shock
- Retain heat for hours with minimal charcoal
- Last for decades with proper care

The result was a cooker that preserved the ancient thermal principles of the kamado but with modern durability. It was a game-changer.

## The EGG Family Today

What started as a single cooker on an Atlanta sidewalk has grown into a global phenomenon. Big Green Egg now offers **seven sizes**:

| Size | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **Mini** | Tabletop, picnics, camping |
| **MiniMax** | Portable with full capability |
| **Small** | Balconies, small spaces |
| **Medium** | Couples, small families |
| **Large** | The classic — most popular size |
| **XLarge** | Large families, entertaining |
| **2XL** | Big gatherings, competition cooking |

The **Large** remains the bestseller — the same size and shape that started it all over fifty years ago.

## Kamado & Tandoor — Ancient Cousins

The kamado and tandoor evolved independently on opposite sides of Asia, yet they share a remarkable amount of DNA. Both are born from the same insight: **clay and fire, sealed together, cook food like nothing else can.**

| | Kamado | Tandoor |
|---|---|---|
| **Origin** | China / Japan | Indus Valley / Persia |
| **Age** | ~3,000 years | ~4,600 years |
| **Shape** | Egg / dome with lid | Tall cylinder, open top |
| **Material** | Clay (now advanced ceramics) | Clay mixed with grass fibre |
| **Heat range** | 90–400°C (low-and-slow to searing) | 260–480°C+ (high heat) |
| **Strength** | Versatility — grill, smoke, bake, roast | Extreme heat — naan, kebabs, tikka |
| **Fuel** | Lump charcoal | Charcoal or wood |
| **Key principle** | Thick walls retain heat; sealed dome traps moisture | Thick walls radiate intense heat; open top vents smoke |

**What they share:**

- **Clay construction** that absorbs, retains, and radiates heat evenly
- **Incredible fuel efficiency** — both cook for hours on surprisingly little charcoal
- **Distinctive flavour** — food tastes fundamentally different from metal grills
- **Designs unchanged for millennia** — because they got it right the first time

The kamado excels at **range** — you can hold 100°C for an overnight brisket or crank to 400°C for pizza. The tandoor excels at **intensity** — its open-top design and extreme heat produce the blistered naan and charred tikka that no other cooker can replicate. Together, they represent two branches of the same ancient clay cooking tradition, separated by geography but united by physics.

## Why It Works

The magic of the kamado hasn't changed in thousands of years. It comes down to physics:

- **Ceramic insulation** holds heat with very little fuel
- **Sealed dome** traps moisture for juicy results
- **Adjustable vents** give precise temperature control — from 90°C slow smoking to 400°C pizza-oven searing
- **Lump charcoal** burns clean with no chemical additives

Whether you're smoking a brisket for 14 hours or searing a steak in 90 seconds, the Egg handles it all — just as its clay ancestors did millennia ago.
